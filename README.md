# Anaerobic Single-Cell Dispensing (SCD) for anaerobic cultivation of bacteria from complex samples


This is the GitHub repository for Afrizal et al (2022) where a single-cell dispensing approach was applied to complex faecal samples, allowing us to determine the benefit of this approach compared to traditional plate-based cultivation methods.
